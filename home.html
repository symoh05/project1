<h2>The Journey of Barack Obama</h2>
<img src="obama.jpg" alt="President Barack Obama">
<p>Barack Hussein Obama II was born on August 4, 1961, in Honolulu, Hawaii. He made history as the first African American to be elected president of the United States, serving from January 20, 2009, to January 20, 2017.</p>
<p>Obama's father, Barack Obama Sr., was a Kenyan economist who studied in the U.S. on a scholarship. His mother, Ann Dunham, was an American anthropologist from Kansas. This unique multicultural background would later shape Obama's worldview and political perspective.</p>
<p>Obama attended Occidental College in Los Angeles before transferring to Columbia University in New York, where he graduated in 1983 with a degree in political science. After working as a community organizer in Chicago, he earned his law degree from Harvard in 1991, where he made history as the first Black president of the prestigious Harvard Law Review.</p>
